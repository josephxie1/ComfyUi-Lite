# Canny

**Category**: image/preprocessors

**Also known as**: edge detection, outline, contour detection, line art

## Description

Extract all edge lines from photos, like using a pen to outline a photo, drawing out the contours and detail boundaries of objects.

## Working Principle

Imagine you are an artist who needs to use a pen to outline a photo. The Canny node acts like an intelligent assistant, helping you decide where to draw lines (edges) and where not to.

This process is like a screening job:

- **High threshold** is the "must draw line standard": only very obvious and clear contour lines will be drawn, such as facial contours of people and building frames
- **Low threshold** is the "definitely don't draw line standard": edges that are too weak will be ignored to avoid drawing noise and meaningless lines
- **Middle area**: edges between the two standards will be drawn together if they connect to "must draw lines", but won't be drawn if they are isolated

The final output is a black and white image, where white parts are detected edge lines and black parts are areas without edges.
